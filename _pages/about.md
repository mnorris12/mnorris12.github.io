Hello, there! My name is Marqualand Norris, although I typically go by Sora, and I'm an Undergraduate Astrophysics researcher at [Swarthmore College's department of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.swarthmore.edu/physics-astronomy).

My ongoing research is a continuation of my 2025 summer research project at Northwestern's CIERA (Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics) [REU](https://sites.northwestern.edu/cierareu/). My research advisor is Alexander Tchekhovskoy and I, are focusing on understanding the behavior of large-scale magnetic fields in Magnetically Arrested Disks (MAD) of Active Galactic. We investigate how much magnetic flux can we “stuff” into the accretion disks of Active Galactic Nuclei. In particular, we look at the case of dense thin non-radiative disks in the MAD regime.

Potential to expand on the paragraph above, adding details. 

Past Research Experience.
